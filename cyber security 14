Types of Cloud : 
   => public  ---------> single man user 
          Eg : Website
   => private ----------> private for particular person details
         Eg : inside the organization
   => Hybird ----------> mix of public and private
         Eg : In an organization they use both clouds
   => Community ---------> group of organization use same servers and shared a resources.
         Eg : Access given to some people in a community.(Kaggle) etc....

   => AWS
   => Google cloud
   => Azure
   => Digital Ocean etc......
Cloud Security Challenges : 
   => Data breaches
   => Compliances concerns
   => Insiders Threats
   => Data Loss
Regulatory Compliance in cloud Security  :
   => GDPR  - General Data Protection Regulation  -----------> EU{Countries} all should follow this rule.
   => G
   => HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -----------> In US{Countries}they follow this medical rules and regulations otherwise they will not provide license.
   => PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ----------> All payments around world were control by them.
   => ISO 27001 - ISO/IEC 27001 is the international standard for information security for people. ------------> {Information Security Management System - ISMS}
CMM LEVEL ----------------> {Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a methodology used to develop, refine maturity of an organizations software development process.}
   => Initial
   => Managed
   => Defined
   => Quantitatively Managed
   => Optimizing
Future Treands in Cloud Security : 
   => Adoption Zero Trust 
           * DAC - Discrinary Access Control  ----------> most superior power according to your requirements they provide power.
           * RBAC - Role Based Access Control -----------> According to the role they provide powers and access
           * MAC - Mandatory Access Control -------------> Mandatory access and power only will provide.
Domain Controller / Active Directories --------> separate login for each person in a same system.
CISCO WSA Features : 
     WSA - Windows Subsystem for Android.
     Data Security Enforcement
           => DLP - Data Loss Prevention
           => Native FTP Protection  -------> famous tool for ftp is "putty"
WAF - Web Application Firewall
    => Top WAF is "cloud fare".
    => It is in layer 7 b/w client and server.
    => Detecting and defending the dos and Ddos attack for rate limiting.
Types of WAF : 
    => Network
    => Host
    => Cloud
Types of Attack : 
   => Dos
   => Ddos
   => XSS - Cross-Site Scripting
   => SQL Injection
   => Man In The Middle
   => Zero-day 
List in WAF :
   => Blocklist
   => Whitelist
SQL Injection : 
   => using ' or " cotes we can find it.
   => How to prevent it ?
            ====>  utilizing parameterized database queries with bound, typed parameters and careful use of parameterized stored procedures in the database.
Path Traversal : 
    => Local file
    => Remote file
Man In The Middle attack - tool in Kali is ettercap to hear the data b/w users and application.
                         - mostly in public WiFi places we can detect it.
                         - Risk ----> No https secure protocol here
SE toolkit - Social Engineering tool in kali.
Types of Vulnerability : 
   => Hardware 
   => Network  ------> Social
   => Software
Standard Operating Procedure - SOP ------------> Time constraints.If you fail to do this you will fired.
   => High
   => Medium
   => Low
SIEM VS SOAR
EDR VS XDR
SLA - Service Level Agreement
Splunk VS Wazuh
What Is the MITRE ATT&CK Framework?
    => MITRE ATT&CK -(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)
    => ATT&CK is designed to help cybersecurity analysts and other stakeholders gain Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) insights 
       for planning and designing cybersecurity programs and facilitate communication by providing a common cybersecurity reference vocabulary.
    => MITRE ATT&CK uses the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) perspective to organize cybersecurity knowledge into a hierarchical framework.
Playbook / Rulebook - A plan you develop that outlines the steps you will take in the event of a security incident.
MITRE ATT&CK Tactics : 
            => Reconnaissance (Enterprise, ICS)
            => Resource Development (Enterprise, ICS)
            => Initial Access
            =>  Execution
            =>  Persistence
            =>  Privilege Escalation
            =>  Defense Evasion
            =>  Credential Access (Enterprise, Mobile)
            =>  Discovery
            =>  Lateral Movement
            =>  Collection
            =>  Command and Control
            =>  Exfiltration (Enterprise, Mobile)
            =>  Impact 
            => Network Effects (Mobile-only)
            =>  Network Service Effects (Mobile-only)
            =>  Inhibit Response Function (ICS-only)
            =>  Impair Process Control (ICS-only)  
Offensive use only first 6 steps in Mitre Att&ck
