Why we need cyber security? 
    => Protecting ourself,or oranization etc....
Forbes publication for cyber security.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Live cyber threat map 
* Radware
* Bitdefender
    => to check current cyber attacks around world.
    => good company for anti-virus software.
* Black Hat,White Hat,Grey Hat  => Hackers type
* Zero-day Vulnerability - still not found that vulnerability / solution not found vulnerabilities.
* CIA =>
  C - Confidentiality  -----> tamper the data to use only by me like private and at the rest
  I - Integrity   --------->  remoting the data or non-tampered the data that shows the originality.
  A - Availability ---------> Available for the users or for the organinzation.
* OSCP - Offensive Security Certificate Personnel
   => Download the template for project survey.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Types of FootPrinting / Info-gathering : 
   => Active  -  Obtain information by directly interacting with the target.
              -  you could surf public internet sites manually, query DNS, or use open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering tools to automate the discovery of information.
   => Passive -  Obtain information without direct interaction with the target. 
              -  This means obtaining publicly available information using things such as: search engines, certificate information, social media postings, and even job postings.
* OSINT framework - OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources.
* Have I been pwned ? - To chech ur data is leaked in any dark weebsites or not.
* Ahmia - To search the content in dark web like onion.
* Maintaining the access - through torjan,back door etc...
* Phising - cloning the website and tricking someone (or) Social Engineering attack.
* Malware - Malicious Software - viruses,spyware,rootkit,Torjans,bots or botnets,worm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interview Questions---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Worm - automaticaly will attack the system or the entire company.
* Virus - not automatically will attack.
* CNC - Command and Control.
* Trojan - Seems like legitimate website but actually a malicious software that attack our system.
         - Always check the Integrity of software you'r downloading.
* Ransomware - Ransomware is a type of malware that holds a victim’s data or device hostage, threatening to keep it locked—or worse—unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker as Bitcoin.
* DoS VS Ddos ? 
    DoS - To down  the srvice 
    Ddos - multiple people attacking or trafficing the same website.
* Insider Threats : 
        => Intentional
        => UnIntentional
* DNS Hijacking
* Brute Force Attack - All possible permutatuions and Combinations.
* Dictionary Attack - All the available words.
* IoT Attack - like arduino,devices etc....
* Main-In-The-Middle Attack - intermediate person will attack 
* Backdoor Attack - whenever we need we can use it / it is like persistent.
* Enumeration - estep by step process of xtracting username,passwords,etc...
* SNMP - Simple Network Message Protocol.
* Threat Actors - Cyber Actors may be legal or illegal 
               - Bad actors / Adversary in technically other name for hackers.
* Nation-state-actors - one nation hack another nation data
* Hactivist 
* Cyber Terrorist
 ----------------------------------------------------interview question -------------------------------------------------
* IR Team - Incident Response Team 
          - Incident ----------> it will affect the CIA                      
   => NIST Cybersecurity Framework / standard
     ---------> National Institute of Standards and Technology - very good framework for SOC Analyst(defensive)
   => Frameworks like : 
        * Identify
        * Project
        * Detect
        * Respond
        * Recover
* How do you assess the risk ?
    => X - Livelihood
    => Y -  Impact
    => then detect the level of risk (low,high,medium etc...) then give the report.
* SAS Tool - Static Application Security Testing Tool.
-----------------------------------------------------------NETWORKS---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Network Segmentation => Traffic can be restricted in or to segments based on location, along with where traffic can and cannot flow.
* DLP - Data Loss Prevention
      - It has some tool to protect our data.
* IPS => Intrusion Prevention Systems.
      => To identify malicious activity, collect information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it. 
      => To prevent  and take action.
      => It is placed between Firewall and Router.
* IDS => An Intrusion Detection System.
      => It maintains network traffic looks for unusual activity and sends alerts when it occurs.
      => 2 types :
           * HIDS - Host based Intrusion Detection System.
           * NIDS - Network based Intrusion Detection System.
* NIDS => Network intrusion detection systems 
       => They are set up at a planned point within the network to examine traffic from all devices on the network.
* Firewall - It actually block the Traffic in transport layer.
* NAT - It is also a firewall
* Stateless connection - state of the packet doen't known.
                       - If the RST Packet session ended.
* Statefull connection - state of the packet known by firewall before the reset of flag.
                       - If the RST Packet session running on.
* VPN VS Proxy ? 
* Email Security => the gateway for Email's.
* Anti-virus or Anti-Malware Software
* NAC - Network Access Control.
* MDM - Mobile Device Management System
* CASB - Cloud Access Security Broker
* Asymentric and Symentric Encryption 
* Cryptography Attacks :
     => chosen plaintext attack
     => chosen ciphertext attack
* 3 types of security control :
     => Physical
     => Administrative
     => Logical / technical
