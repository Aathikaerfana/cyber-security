* Hashcat-open source password cracking tool.
* John the Ripper- advanced offline password cracker, which supports hundreds of hash and cipher types, and runs on many operating systems, CPUs, GPUs, and even some FPGAs.
* Hydra(THC-Hydra)- It is fast,flexible and easy it is to gain.
The above tools are used a common terminology called as Brute Force.

* Brute Force:A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. 
            It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizationsâ€™ systems and networks. 
            The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information.
* vulnerability:weakness for networks.
* RAT: A RAT (remote access Trojan) is malware an attacker uses to gain full administrative privileges and remote control of a target computer.
* Attacks: =>using someone's system/software without their permission.
           =>both hardware/software attacks.
* Port Scanning
* Security & safe guarding the system
=> physical control
=> administrative control
=> logical control
* Cyber Security: securing the source/data.
* Networking :A medium to connection.
* TCP/UDP : => Protocols(set of rules).
            => communicate with hardware and software
            => TCP has 65535 ports(entry gate) and UDP has 65535 ports.
* https : port 443 will run with lock symbol which is safe and secure.
* http : port 80 with unsafe and secured platform.
* HTTP/HTTPs - diff b/w
* Block chain security
* Exlpoit
* SQL injection
* Session Hijacking - without password and username we can access the account.
* Internet Phising
* DNS Poising
* IP Address
* Cloud 
* Cryptography
* APR poising
* Spoofing
* Hashing
* Meta sploit
* Back door
* Hacking - gaining unauthorized access.
* Ethical Hacking - with return concerns/permission.
* Web Application penetration Testing.
* Web Application VS Website VS Web Server VS Webpage.
* Web Application - user interactions are more.
* Website - collection of webpages.
* Webpages - shows content,images,text etc....
* Webserver - Browsing system or computer by the user.
